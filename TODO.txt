Craftable Legendary slots
 - Craft legendary modifiers as mods from rare loot + credits

#--------------------------------------------------------
# TODO
#--------------------------------------------------------
Add more mastery research projects

# Perks
Adjust the 'unlock' only perks:
gastronomy, surveying, botany, spacesuit design, weapon engineering, zoology, chemistry, outpost engineering, and starship design

Apply the Geology resource boost to Botany output too.

# Enemies
Increase min enemy level

Increase spawn rate of small fauna (especially scavengers)
Significantly increase the health of high level fauna (as in level 60+)

# Temples
Change puzzle to Starborn fight instead

# Items
Boost survey data item price so it sells for a decent chunk even with the debuff

Reduce the ivalue modifier that legendary omods apply so item price isn't stupidly high

Adjust credit cost on the research projects

# Resources
Add Refined X (e.g. Refined Iron) that costs lots of base resource. Refined X sells for a chunk of credits.
