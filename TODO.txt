Add more mastery research projects

# Perks
Adjust the 'unlock' only perks:
gastronomy, surveying, botany, spacesuit design, weapon engineering, zoology, chemistry, outpost engineering, and starship design

# Enemies
Increase min enemy level

Increase spawn rate of small fauna (especially scavengers)
Significantly increase the health of high level fauna (as in level 60+)

# Weapons
Increase damage of grenades and mines

# Temples
Change puzzle to Starborn fight instead

# Vendors
Rebalance item prices
Increased player base buy price % (e.g. 1000%),

Example:
Frag Grande goes down to 35 credits per.
Base % at 2000%, means player buys for 700 credits per.

Buy adjustments reduce the innate debuff.
